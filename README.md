# mc

`mc` is a command line filter inspired by the Unix tools `expr` and `bc`.
When finished, it'll be able to do relational operations and arithmetic with integers
or floating point numbers, and perform bitwise operations.

## Possible features in the future

- Do algebra (simplify expressions, solve equations and systems of equations)
- Maybe do calculus
- Output algebra in `roff` and/or TeX syntax

## TODO

- Add functions
- Find way to parse relational operators
- Write `mc`
- Learn about computer algebra
