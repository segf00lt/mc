# mexpr

`mexpr` is a beefed up version of the gnu core utility `expr` specialized for math.
When finished, it'll be able to:

- Compute bitwise operations and numerical expressions
- Solve equations and systems of equations
- Maybe do calculus

Also, in addition to performing these calculations on numbers, variables can be
manipulated aswell. These variabled cannot be assigned as in a programming
language, instead they behave as variables do in algebra. Therefor as well as
calculations `mexpr` can simplify algebraic expressions.

## TODO

- Learn about computer algebra
- Test grammar spec
- The stuff in the README
- Write `mexpr`
