# mc

`mc` is a command line tool inspired by the Unix tools `expr` and `bc`. When
finished, it'll be able to do relational, bitwise and arithmetic operations on
real, whole and natural numbers (some operations are restricted to certain
domains, see `parser.y`).

## Potential features

- Do algebra (simplify expressions, solve equations and systems of equations)
- Maybe do calculus
- Output algebra in `roff` and/or TeX syntax

## TODO

- Write a `print()` function
- Add relational operations to `mc`
- Learn about computer algebra
